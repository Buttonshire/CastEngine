CastEngine

Paul Zirkle


Goal of this project is to create a re-usable engine for spells and abilities found in most MMO/RPG/Action/Etc games.

Examples include casting a fireball, attacking with a sword, firing a travelling rocket projectile, chanelling an AOE healing spell, or buffing a group of players.

By making a robust engine, a game can be made which exposes the components of abilities to users and allows them to customize their own.


In order to develop this project, I'll be making a game similar to "Grind Quest" in order to cut down on art/physics/etc requirements and focus on the CastEngine features.


DEVELOPING and INSTALLATION:

This project is built on top of Cocos2D-x.

It expects to live under the "Projects" folder of the current Cocos2D-x environment. Ex: C:\Code\Cocos2Dx\cocos2d-2.1rc0-x-2.1.3\projects\CastEngine\

I am developing in Windows 7 64 bit but targeting 32 bit. I am using MS Visual Studio Express 2012. 
I have also built out proj.ios and proj.mac in XCode 4.6.1 and confirmed they are working.

Similar effort will be needed to get the other platform projects working.

Other project types have been made by macro but are untested (and the project generated was originally named "Test" instead of "CastEngine")
